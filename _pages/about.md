&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I am a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the [Laboratory of Systems Genetics](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/systems-genetics#Meet-the-Team), SBC, NHLBI at Bethesda, Maryland. I study the interaction between the `circadian clock` and `sleep` genetic networks, and how these interactions shape various behavior and physiological responses. During my PhD, I worked on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying `complex behaviors`, specifically timing of a behavior ([chronotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype)), under the influence, or independent of the circadian clock, at the [Chronobiology and Behavioural Neurogenetics Laboratory](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/sheeba), JNCASR. My studies use diverse methodologies - from `statistical modeling` of behavior to `quantitative genetics` and `multi-omics` techniques. Previously, I have also worked on thermo-sensitive `Transient Receptor Potential` (TRP) channels and their role in osteogenesis, using rodent models, primary bone cells, pharmacological modulators, and molecular dynamics during my masters studies at [NISER](https://www.niser.ac.in/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in [Burdwan, WB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardhaman), in India. I went to [RKMV, Purulia](https://rkmvp.org/) and [RKMV, Narendrapur](https://www.rkmvnarendrapur.org/) for my secondary and higher secondary school, repectively. I then joined [NISER, Bhubaneswar](https://www.niser.ac.in/) for an integrated MSc (BS-MS dual degree) degree in Life Sciences, with special focus on `cell biology` and `bioinformatics`. After my PhD from the [Neurosciences Unit](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/research/research-units/neuroscience-unit) at the JNCASR in [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), I moved to the USA (specifically, [Bethesda, MD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland)), to join the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/) as a postdoctoral fellow. Apart from my work in the lab, I am a leisure photographer, connoisseur of sci-fi (old and new) and good food!
